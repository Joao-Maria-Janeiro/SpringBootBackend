Project developed during my internship at NSC SAP Portugal under the [mentor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianborges/).

This is a microservice based on [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to provide RESTFul web services for E-Commerce platforms following the principles of the Scrum framework.

* Use the Bitbucket version controll
* Use the Trello application to create an Agile Task Board
* Create the relational JPA mapping with the provided UML class diagram as basis
* Use the "Software Craftsmanship" and "Clean Code" mindsets
* Create Integration and Unit Tests
* The endpoints must be RESTFul, use Security Token and JSON payloads
*Must respect the design patterns(Strategy, Facade, Service, Repository)
* Must use Java8's new resources such as Stream API, Optionals and Lambdas
* Use the following technologies: IntelliJ Idea, Maven, Spring Boot, Git, RESTFul services, Spring DATA, JPA Entities, Lombok Project, JSON, Apache Lang Utils and Google Guava
